# **Reminate** ü§î

## Is this image AI-generated?

> **NOTE: THIS IS AN ESM PACKAGE, USING IT IN A COMMONJS CONTEXT IS NOT RECOMMENDED.** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a (**_NON-OFFICIAL_**) wrapper over [**Illuminarty**]("https://illuminarty.ai") via Playwright.

# Usage üìÑ

```js
import { scan } from "reminate";
```

The API is pretty simple, it's literally just one method, if `0x907A70` adds anything new I'll try to include it as soon as possible.

## scan(img[, options])

- `img` - An image `Buffer`.[^1]
- `options` - Options `Object`.
  - `options.mime` - MIME type of the file, by default uses magic numbers, you can override the behaviour with this.[^2]
  - `options.v` - Verbosity option, for debugging purposes.

Example code:

```js
import { scan } from "reminate";
const img = Buffer.from(  "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAYAAAAJCAYAAAARml2dAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAACnSURBVAjXPcyxbcJAAADAi+UBvsBy8wUuPAFCKAXKAnRuGSAjZJAUGSCtq3gDKoQ8AZHexTcWRGIDKJByA9zL/e3n/qk3NqxiNB+yvZXiDzMi5pxlyQ0lk7qJ1t0GDH0vJIorxpSFqhKqSk5AqVmSRt/D4F+zVCw+WnEbqWsQt9HivVX+ns9kdru1gNvl4oryNE0OKctfz6rrNkKgND/blDI4HnltWw9VhjdFJre8DQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==",
  "base64"
);

console.log(await scan(img));
```

## WIP üìù

- Proxying to circumvent rate-limit.
- Replacing Playwright with form emulation.

## Footnotes ü¶∂

[^1]: has to be a `Buffer`, support for b64 and URL may come, but no guarantees, it's not like it's that hard anw to just preprocess. ü§∑
[^2]: Illuminarty currently only supports `["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "webp", "jfif"]`.
